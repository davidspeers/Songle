# Songle 

Songle is a location based mobile phone puzzle game which allows users to follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburghâ€™s Central Area. The words make up the lyrics of a well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words which have been found.

The app was made using Android Studio, Kotlin, and the Google Maps API over the course of 11 weeks for the Computer Science Large Practical in 2017
